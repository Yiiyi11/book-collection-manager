# Small-Scale Book Collection Management Web Application
## Project Background
This project is Assignment A2 for the ISYS3001 course. It aims to develop a web application that supports book information management, featuring functions such as book entry, search and filtering, and CSV export (Firebase is not used; localStorage is adopted for local storage).

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: HTML5 + CSS3 + JavaScript + Bootstrap 5 (responsive layout)
- Data Storage: localStorage (browser local storage, no backend/third-party services required)
- Export Function: SheetJS (xlsx.js, generates CSV files on the frontend)
- Version Control: Git + GitHub (branch management and code hosting)
- Local Preview: VS Code Live Server extension

## Functional Modules
1. Book Entry: Supports input of book title, author, ISBN, reading status, and category; data is stored locally.
2. Book Management: Displays books in a list, enables keyword search (by title/author), and supports category filtering (by status/category).
3. List Export: Exports book data stored locally in CSV format, with optimized Chinese encoding support.

## Development Cycle
Weeks 1-5 (September 14 - October 1, 2025)
